HALLO! Welcome to my Terrorism in Israel from 1971 - 2016 data cleaning and data exploration project. 
In the SQL file you'll see my data cleaning and my analyse:
* I droped and updated columns, fixed wrong data.
* I've looked for the city and year where most were murdered.
* I've looked at the number of murders and wounded.
* I've looked at the most common terrorism attack.
* I've looked at rolling numbers murdered in Jerusalem.
* I've looked at the largest victim group of the terrorism.
* I Showed what percentage of terror attacks were succeed.
* I've looked for the most dangerous city by successful attacks.
